# backup-system



This script will prompt you for the name of the backup directory. The backup directory will then be created, and the entire system will be backed up to a tar.gz file in the specified directory.

Here are some additional notes about the script:

- The tar command is used to create a backup.
- The -czf option is used to create a compressed tar file.
- The / option is used to backup the entire system.
- The date command is used to get the current date.
- The read command is used to get input from the user.
- The echo command is used to display messages to the user.
